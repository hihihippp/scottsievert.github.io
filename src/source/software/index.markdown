## [swix]

Swift Matrix Library. Brings a Python/MATLAB like programming interface to
smartphones because Apple recently released Swift for iOS 8. Makes it easy to
bring complicated signal processing algorithms to smartphones, the reason it
was developed!

## [jem-press]

A simple static site generator very similar to [jem-doc].  If you want a
preview, take a look at the [documentation] (implemented in jem-press!). This
is best suited for static sites without a blog; it was designed with academic
sites in mind.

## [python-drawnow]

Very similar to Matlab's `drawnow` with some additional features. It allows you
to drop to to a debugger or ask for a confirm every iteration.
