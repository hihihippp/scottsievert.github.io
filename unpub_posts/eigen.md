Eigenvalues are shrouded in mystery and seem to have all sorts of magic effects. I've recently had the chance to learn what eigenvalues really are and have seen some of the powerful effects. I won't try to cover two months of Applied Linear Algebra, so I'll just touch on the benefits.

Eigenvalues are just used as a convenient way to represent a matrix.
