## Research interests
<p style="font-size:12pt;">
<em>Adaptive sampling theory, learning theory, statistical signal processing,
compressed sensing</em>
</p>

Why are these interesting? One example is because any real world signal has areas that are similar in value. Real world images have areas that tend to be the same color and speech signals have fairly similar values. If constrained by time or money, why not use all the data at your disposal? This requires looking for the areas with the most detail, and [Prof. Jarvis Haupt] has done a [great talk] on it.

Making these natural and intuitive assumptions seems to be the basis behind compressed sensing. A good overview is included in a [Wired article].

## Education
I am currently finishing undergraduate career at the University of Minnesota in Electrical Engineering with a focus in signal processing. I would like to earn my doctorate so I can devise my own solutions.

## Software
* [swix], the Swift Matrix Library. Brings a Python/MATLAB like interface to
  smartphones.
* [jem-press]. A simple static site generator very similar to [jem-doc].
  If you want a preview, take a look at the [documentation] (implemented in
  jem-press!).
* [python-drawnow]. Very similar to Matlab's `drawnow` with some additional
  features.
